### Dependency Management

Kinsta automatically installs dependencies defined in your `package.json` file during the deployment process.

### Setting the Build Command, Node version, and Publish directory

After connecting the repository, **Static Site Hosting** will automatically try to populate all the fields with the correct values.
|  |  |
|---|---|
| Build command | `npm run build` |
| Node version  |  16.20  |
| Publish directory | `dist`  |


### Deployment Lifecycle

Whenever a deployment is initiated (through creating an application or re-deploying due to an incoming commit), the build command is run, followed by the deployment of the Publish Directory content.

### Dependency Management

Kinsta automatically installs dependencies defined in your `package.json` file during the deployment process.

### Port

Kinsta automatically sets the `PORT` environment variable. You should **not** define it yourself and you should **not** hard-code it into the application. The `serve` package utilizes the port set by Kinsta automatically.

### Start Command

When deploying an application, Kinsta automatically creates a web process with `npm start` as the entry point. Make sure to use this command to run your server.

### Deployment Lifecycle

Whenever a deployment is initiated (through creating an application or re-deploying due to an incoming commit), the `npm build` command is run, followed by the `npm start` command.
